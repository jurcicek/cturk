<p> 
The aim of CTURK is to automate process of conducting experiments with subjects participating in a set of various task, called HITs.
For example, a HIT can be an evaluation of spoken dialogue system or transcribing a set of audio recordings. 
</p>
<p> 
The main use cases of CTURK are:
<ul>
	<li>Register subjects</li>
	<li>Let subjects conduct evaluation</li> 
	<li>Collect statistics about the executed evaluations</li>
	<li>Pay subjects</li> 
</ul>
</p>

<p>
In the CTURK framework are two types of users: requesters and workers.
</p>
<p>
The requesters publish work on the CTURK in the form of HITs and pay workers for their succesful completion of the HITs.
</p>
<p>
The workers complete the puchlished HITs, wait for their work being accepted and when they earn a minimum amount of money then they can request to be paid.
</p>

<p> 
The next sections provide basic information on how to corectly and efficiently use the CTURK famework.
